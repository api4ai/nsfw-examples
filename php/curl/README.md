# API4AI NSFW image classification sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI NSFW Image Classification API.
The sample is implemented in `PHP` using [cURL](https://www.php.net/manual/ru/book.curl.php) extension.


## Overview

This API processes images and detects sexual content in them, marking the images as Safe For Work (SFW) or Not Safe For Work (NSFW).


## Getting started

*PHP version `7.x` or greater and `php-curl` extension is required to run this script.*

Try sample with default args:

```bash
php index.php
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
php index.php image.jpg
```
