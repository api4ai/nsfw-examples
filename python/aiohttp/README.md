# API4AI NSFW image classification

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI NSFW image classification API. The sample is implemented in  `python` using [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) module.


## Overview

This API processes images and detects sexual content in them, marking the images as Safe For Work (SFW) or Not Safe For Work (NSFW).


## Getting started

Preinstall dependencies before use:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
python3 sample.py
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
python3 sample.py image.jpg
```
