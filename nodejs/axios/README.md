# API4AI NSFW image classification sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI NSFW Image Classification API.
The sample is implemented in `nodejs` using [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [from-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/form-data) packages.


## Overview

This API processes images and detects sexual content in them, marking the images as Safe For Work (SFW) or Not Safe For Work (NSFW).


## Getting started

*NodeJS version `8.3.0` or greater is required to run this script.*

Preinstall dependencies before use:

```bash
npm i --production
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
node index.js
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
node index.js image.jpg
```
