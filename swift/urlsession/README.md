# API4AI NSFW image classification sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI NSFW Image Classification API.
The sample is implemented in `Swift` using [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) class.


## Overview

This API processes images and detects sexual content in them, marking the images as Safe For Work (SFW) or Not Safe For Work (NSFW).


## Getting started (XCode)

Open `sample.xcodeproj` project in XCode as usual and click "Run".

Optionally you may specify image URL or path to image file as application argument via "Product -> Scheme -> Edit scheme...".


## Getting started (Command line)

Build in Release configuration:
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme sample build -configuration Release SYMROOT=$(PWD)/build
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
./build/Release/sample
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
./build/Release/sample image.jpg
```
